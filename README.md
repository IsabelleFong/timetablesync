> macOs application that syncs your APSpace timetable to Microsoft Outlook

## üéØ Objective
TimetableSync is used to automate the process of adding weekly timetables from APSpace Website (Asia Pacific University Application) to Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams on macOS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1. A weekly recurring event is set on the local Calendar application. During the time of the event, the Calendar will trigger the launch of the ``automationApp.app``. 
2. ``automationApp.app`` runs ``main.py`` which will scrape the timetable data from APSpace website and convert the raw data into an iCalendar file (ICS).
3. ``automationApp.app`` will then continue to run ``automationScript.scpt`` to import the iCalendar file (ICS) generated to the Microsoft Outlook Desktop application.
4. Once the iCalendar file has been added ``automationApp.app`` will run ``sendEmail.scpt`` to send you an email indicating that the weekly calendar has been added successfully to your Microsoft Outlook Calendar.
5. The new calendar will appear on both your Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Microsoft Teams Calendar.
